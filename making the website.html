        i already had a rough idea of what i wanted the vibe of my website to look like, so i started off with a rough
        paper step. then, i used a website to create a wireframe. the website that i used was called
        <a href="https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/"> wireframepro</a>. the design that i generated looked like this â†’

      <h2 class="highlight-pink1">playing with the website's elements...<img class="icon" src="icons8-web-design-64.png" alt="web design icon"/></h2>
      <p>
        i found that most of the time on this website was spent tinkering with the css styling to my liking. once you
        have a basic structure down, i would focus on enhancing your website and making it unique to you. for getting
        the basic elements down, i referrred to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> w3schools </a>, Google, Youtube and 
        looking at other websites that i thought would be a good challenge to recreate certain elements. in particular, 
        once i got the basic texts, divs and whatnot, i focused on things like a navbar, a scroll bar, icons, highlighting, 
        underlining, bolding etc.

      <p> if you would say you have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of html and css, then i would recommend <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> codeacademy  </a> 
        and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> w3schools </a> (again!). when making this website, i had some basic knowledge in both so i got by with checking w3schools and googling any specific queries i had.
        i would also say that it is very likely you will come across some issues with how things are formatted on the page, and it's really a matter
        of trying to physically understand where the issue is stemming from. for example, if an element is moving when you want it to be fixed,
         consider whether there is a css property that could resolve that. i would also recommend using vsc, or any IDE, to be able to track certain
         elements within the stylesheet and the actual html file.

          clean up any bulk css styling that you don't need -> your code will be easier to read
