        <p>
          i already had a rough idea of what i wanted the vibe of my website to look like, so i started off with a rough
          paper step. then, i used a website to create a wireframe. the website that i used was called
          <a href="https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/"> wireframepro</a>. the design that i generated looked like this â†’

        <p>
          i found that most of the time on this website was spent tinkering with the css styling to my liking. once you
          have a basic structure down, i would focus on enhancing your website and making it unique to you. for getting
          the basic elements down, i referrred to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> w3schools </a>, Google, Youtube and 
          looking at other websites that i thought would be a good challenge to recreate certain elements. in particular, 
          once i got the basic texts, divs and whatnot, i focused on things like a navbar, a scroll bar, icons, highlighting, 
          underlining, bolding etc.

        <p> if you would say you have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of html and css, then i would recommend <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/"> codeacademy  </a> 
          and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> w3schools </a> (again!). when making this website, i had some basic knowledge in both so i got by with checking w3schools and googling any specific queries i had.
          i would also say that it is very likely you will come across some issues with how things are formatted on the page, and it's really a matter
          of trying to physically understand where the issue is stemming from. for example, if an element is moving when you want it to be fixed,
           consider whether there is a css property that could resolve that. i would also recommend using vsc, or any IDE, to be able to track certain
           elements within the stylesheet and the actual html file.

        <p> keep the colour scheme and theme consistent throughout the process.

          clean up any bulk css styling that you don't need -> your code will be easier to read
