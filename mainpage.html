    <h2 class="highlight-pink1">how i made this website and you can too...</h2>
    <p>
      i was inspired initially by athenachermandez, who coded a beautiful portfolio. i used w3schools to inform my basic
      knowledge of html, thus allowing me to be able to further develop this website. to get the website up and running,
      i created an html file named "index.html", then created a css file named "mystyle.css".then, i copied the file
      path of the html file as I was building the skeleton of the website so that I could see what elements were being
      added and removed.
